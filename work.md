## Software Engineer
#### Emerssive Solutions (Dec. 2017 - Aug. 2018)
I worked as a maintainer of a Content Management Application (CMA) called <strong>C3Suite</strong> developed in <em>Ruby on Rails</em> framework. The application primarily helps to create and publish training courses for individuals seeking (or part of) career in EMS (Emergency Medical Services) and related areas.
I contributed a variety of features such as:
* Pretty URLs using the `friendly_id` gem. 
* Developed a tags feature which worked as a category enabling the manager to assign it to different products. This enabled easy discovery of the products belonging to a specific category.
* Developed a feature which enabled the user to keep track of the progress of Quizzes, Flashcards, etc.
* Developed an assessment module to store quiz attempts, it allowed the user to leave the quiz midway and continue from the same point later. The module also provided explanations for incorrect attempts.
* Refactored and contributed a lot of jQuery code to provide appropriate visual aids to the user to increase usability.
* The application UI needed a complete overhaul because it lacked accessibility. Resources were normally 4 to 5 clicks away, I centralized the content and made it accessible from a single page.
* Worked with `ransack` gem which enabled me to do an object-based search on different content types on one of our content management pages.
* Also worked with `Minimagick` for fixing bugs in our image processing workflow for content assets. 
* Used `CanCanCan` gem for managing authorization of different roles. 
* Integrated the Stripe API which enabled the user to purchase a product in a secure way. 

It was my first professional work experience and I learned so much in the process through this project. I really feel like I made a difference on this team.
