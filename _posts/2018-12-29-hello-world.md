Hi there!
This is my first ever blog post and I am so excited to be writing this. I've been reading blogs like [Dev](https://dev.to/) and [Medium](https://medium.com/) for quite some time now, and now its time to start writing my own blogs. One of the primary reasons to be doing this is to document what I learn.

We, humans, tend to forget a lot. Hence, documenting the problems I solve and what I learn will act as a safe for all my work. This will benefit other people who will get to learn something new and myself as well. Also, it feels great to give something back to the community.  
Currently, I work as a web developer, I develop Single Page Applications (SPA's) using Angular 6, write backend code in Ruby on Rails or Spring MVC etc. These are the major frameworks in my technology stack. As a hobby, I'm interested in learning penetration testing, reverse engineering, and malware analysis. I've been a lot busy with my college and now towards the end of my final year, I've decided to start exploring these fields once again while working as a web developer. So, my blog posts will include introductory posts on x86 assembly, basic reverse engineering, web development, and scale. Since these are the topics I will be going through first.
