My name is Faisal Zulfiqar and I am a computer science senior at COMSATS University Islamabad, Lahore Campus.  
I've developed a keen interest in the field of web development, especially in backend systems. I love to work with Ruby on Rails, Angular, NodeJS and a couple of other cool frameworks. 
I've briefly worked as a Software Engineer for a web development agency where I worked on a Ruby on Rails project called C3Suite. I am currently on the lookout for more opportunities.  
In my free time, I love to read books, watch video courses and contribute to open source.
